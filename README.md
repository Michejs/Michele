Hi :raising_hand_man:,
<br>
let me introduce myself.


I'm Michele, I'm 23, I'm a Junior frontend Developer.
After a short visit to the University of Biological Sciences :stop_sign:
<br>
I decided to change and upset my course of study.
I started by seeing html and css courses on Udemy, before joining one of Develhope's classes.:desktop_computer:
<br>
<br>

What am I currently doing?:eyes:
<br>
<br>

I started writing the first  projects in Angular 13,
alongside Bootstrap 5 and also Typescript, not forgetting Javascript.:chart_with_upwards_trend:
<br>
<br>

What are my future goals?:soon:
<br>
<br>

Definitely learn new frameworks or programming languages, however delve further into JS, Angular, Typescript.
You never stop learning with your best friend Google.:shipit:
<br>
<br>

What am I looking for?üßê
<br>
<br>


I am trying to improve myself, improving my skills,
attitudes, problems solving, team work and much more.<br>
Let's say a general level-up.<br>
A goal that I would like to be able to achieve in 2022 
is certainly to be able to enter the working world,<br>
that surrounds my passion and my studies.:rocket::rocket:
